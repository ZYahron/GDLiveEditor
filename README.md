# GDLiveEditor

**Load level string live into the Geometry Dash editor!**

----

**GDLiveEditor** is a project built to provide Geometry Dash editor mode with external program support via pipe. This project is originally started by [Camden314](https://github.com/camden314/) on MACOSX and ported to Windows by me. This project includes some example with codes based on [nekit](https://github.com/NeKitDS/), [Spu7nix](https://github.com/Spu7Nix/), [WEGFan](https://github.com/WEGFan)'s previous works.

## Special thanks

Warning: bad and messy code because C++ skill is kinda bad because this is my first real C++ project.
